Core API Services and Dependencies:
1. @tutkli/jikan-ts - Used in lib/jikan-axios.ts
2. @mateoaranda/jikanjs - Used in lib/jikan.ts
3. Direct fetch API calls - Used in app/anime/[id]/page.tsx and components/anime/random-anime-button.tsx

Hooks Libraries Usage:
1. @/lib/hooks - REMOVED (Consolidated into lib/api-hooks.ts)
2. @/lib/hooks-axios - REMOVED (Consolidated into lib/api-hooks.ts)
3. @/lib/hooks-wrapper - REMOVED (Consolidated into lib/api-hooks.ts)
4. NEW: @/lib/api-hooks.ts - Consolidated implementation of all hook libraries

Potentially Unused Packages:
1. jikanjs - REMOVED (Redundant with @mateoaranda/jikanjs)

Files Consolidation:
1. lib/hooks.ts - REMOVED (Consolidated into lib/api-hooks.ts)
2. lib/hooks-axios.ts - REMOVED (Consolidated into lib/api-hooks.ts)
3. lib/hooks-wrapper.ts - REMOVED (Consolidated into lib/api-hooks.ts)

Completed Cleanup Steps:
1. Identified core API services and dependencies
2. Removed redundant 'jikanjs' package
3. Consolidated hooks libraries into a single lib/api-hooks.ts file
4. Updated component imports to use the new consolidated API hooks file
5. Fixed TypeScript errors in the consolidated API hooks file
6. Removed obsolete hook files (hooks.ts, hooks-axios.ts, hooks-wrapper.ts)

Outcomes:
1. Reduced codebase complexity by removing duplicate implementations
2. Improved maintainability by centralizing API hook logic
3. Reduced package dependencies
4. Fixed TypeScript type issues for better type safety
5. All components now reference a single, consistent API hooks implementation

Future Recommendations:
1. Consider further standardizing direct fetch API calls to use the consolidated hooks
2. Implement automated tests for the API hooks to ensure they behave as expected
3. Setup pre-commit hooks to run linting and type checks automatically
4. Consider extracting common UI components for reuse across the application
